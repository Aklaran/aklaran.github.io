# Incident IQ

As a Software Engineer at Incident IQ, I build AI agent tooling for workflow automation on a platform that serves over 1,800 school districts nationwide. My work spans the full stack — .NET backends, React frontends, and SQL databases.

A key initiative I'm leading is a strangler fig migration of a core database table to a standalone microservice, using shadow testing to ensure correctness before cutover. This approach lets us modernize incrementally without disrupting the platform that schools depend on daily.
