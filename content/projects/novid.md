# NOVID

During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I joined NOVID as an iOS Engineer to help build the world's first pre-exposure contact tracing solution. Unlike conventional Bluetooth-only approaches, NOVID used network theory to provide earlier warnings of potential exposure.

My core contribution was pioneering an ultrasonic ranging protocol — working at the boundaries of Core Audio and Core Bluetooth to calculate device distances using sound waves as a complement to Bluetooth signal strength. I also built performant client-side data handling with Realm and Combine to manage the continuous stream of proximity data.
