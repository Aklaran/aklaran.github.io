# Intuital

At Intuital, I built a generative AI language learning application from the ground up using Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The app leveraged large language models to generate personalized learning content and exercises.

A core challenge was ensuring LLM output quality at scale. I developed evaluation frameworks for prompt flows with regression testing, so we could iterate on prompts with confidence that accuracy wouldn't degrade. My background in Linguistics — specifically second-language acquisition — directly informed the prompt design and pedagogical approach.
