# Hitting the Fan

Hitting the Fan is an AI-powered training tool for wilderness medical emergencies. It simulates high-pressure scenarios where first responders must assess patients, prioritize interventions, and make critical decisions under time pressure.

Born from personal experience in remote alpine environments where help is hours away, the project aims to make realistic scenario practice accessible to anyone who ventures into the backcountry.
