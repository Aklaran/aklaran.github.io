# CodePath

As Lead Adjunct Instructor for CodePath, I taught Web Development 101 and Technical Interview Prep courses to classes of 20+ students, both in person at Georgia State University and virtually. 

My approach to teaching draws on years of experience in different contexts — from formal classrooms to one-on-one mentoring — always centering empathy and meeting students where they are. I designed interactive, accessible lesson plans and mentored aspiring developers through their first codebases and into the industry.
