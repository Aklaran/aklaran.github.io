# Flowmodoro

Flowmodoro is a flexible Pomodoro timer that adapts to how you actually work. Instead of rigid 25-minute blocks, it tracks your flow state and calculates break time proportionally — the longer you focus, the longer your break.

I built this as a tool I wanted to use every day, with a React web app and a native Swift iOS client. It was an exercise in building the same concept across platforms while keeping the experience consistent and simple.
